# Java Resources

If you are looking to learn Java there are a number of resources available to learn from. 

[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/) and [GeeksforGeels](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/) are great websites to learn form.

You can find our old robot code here at our [Frc Github Repo](https://github.com/1138programming/2024-FRC-Robot)

If you want more practice you can find programming challenges at [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) and [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/java)
