# Neccessary Software

This is a list of software used in frc programming. 



## Game Tools


The FRC® Game Tools are software and applications for interfacing with the frc robot. Most of our computers should already have them installed, but they can be downloaded them from [NI](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.frc-game-tools.html#500107). Its recomended to follow the installation steps on the [FRC Installation guide](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html) These are neccessary to be installed in order to doo anything with the robot.

The FRC® Game Tools contains the following software components:

- LabVIEW Update

- FRC Driver Station

- FRC roboRIO Imaging Tool and Images

## WPILib 

The Library that FRC uses for robot proggraming is WPIlib. It Provides the OS that runs on our Robot. You can read the WPIlib Documentation [Here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html) and the [Java API Docs](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/index.html)

## CTRE Pheonix Tuner X

Pheonix Tuner X is an application responsible for CTRE made devices such as the Kraken, Canoviore, Cancoder, and Talon.
