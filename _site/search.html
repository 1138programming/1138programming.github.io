          "content": "Bases\n\nThe base is arguably the most important system for a robot for the simple reason that it allows you to move around the field. Every other system is virtually useless if it cannot move. \nBut before we go into the actual drive bases, it will be useful to know the different types of wheels teams use for these bases. Below is a list of different types of wheels commonly used on the base.\n\nWheels\nTraction Wheel\n\n  Very popular choice (it is the main wheel our team uses)\n  Made up of two main components\n  Metal hub (gives the solidity and shape of the wheel)\n  Rubber tread (wraps around the hub to create traction)\n  To assemble, hubs have threaded holes. You drill holes in the tread, and then use low profile screws to connect the tread to the hub\n\n\nPros:\n\n  Amazing traction (as seen in the name)\n  Relatively light, as most hubs have large holes that remove a lot of material\n  Comes in many sizes\n  Reusable hub\n\n\nCons:\n\n  Constant maintenance\n  Tread needs to be replaced very often, and it can be very annoying to screw them back in (especially during competition)\n  Expensive\n  4-inch hubs cost around $30 on WCP, and 10 feet of 1.5-inch tread costs around $43\n  Creating new tread can be very difficult without a template\n  Cannot strafe on certain drives\n\n\n\n\nUsed traction wheels on a robot made by 111\n\nOmni Wheel\n\n  Has smaller, perpendicular wheels (called rollers) that allow the wheel to strafe without turning\n  Commonly used in the back and/or front of drives with skid steering, allowing for easier turning\n  Holonomic drives require the usage of these wheels\n\n\nPros:\n\n  Amazing turning\n  Does not wear out very quickly, meaning you won’t need to replace it very often\n\n\nCons:\n\n  No traction due to the ability to turn so well\n  Heavy\n  Expensive\n  Costs can range from $20 to $50\n  Can get pieces of carpet stuck in the rollers\n\n\n\n\nOmni wheel from REV Robotics\nMecanum Wheel\n\n  These are very similar to omni wheels, the only difference being that the rollers are at a 45-degree angle\n  Extremely unpopular wheel choice\n  More useful/popular in intakes because of the way the angled rollers guide the game piece\n  Mainly only seen in full-on mecanum drives\n\n\nPros:\n\n  A great and simple way to get strafing on your robot\n\n\nCons:\n\n  No traction due to the ability to strafe\n  Heavy\n  Expensive\n  One of the most expensive wheels, ranging from $50 to over $100\n  Can get pieces of carpet stuck in the rollers\n\n\n\n\nMecanum wheel from AndyMark\n\nColson Wheel\n\n  Extremely popular wheel\n  Also used in order systems, like flywheels\n  Solid, one part wheel (meaning nothing needs to be assembled)\n\n\nPros:\n\n  Good traction\n  Low maintenance because all you need to do it take it off and put a new one on\n  Strong and firm, meaning there is extremely little compliance\n  Does not wear out very quickly\n\n\nCons:\n\n  Heavy\n  Somewhat Expensive\n  Prices CAN range up to $40, but in general, colsons are actually cheaper than many wheels\n\n\n\n\nColson wheel from VEX.com\n\nHi-Grip Wheel\n\n  Proven to be effective in the kit bot\n  Similar to traction wheels, only without the need for assembly\n  Has many durometers available for the outer tread\n\n\nPros:\n\n  Great traction\n  Light, as it is only made up of the tread and the hub, which has large holes to take away material\n  Cheap\n  Prices are usually only around $10, a little more for larger wheels\n\n\nCons:\n\n  Weak hubs (plastic)\n  Tread usually wears out quickly\n  Thin, meaning that it might not fair too well against defense\n\n\nHi-grip wheel from AndyMark, the best place to buy these wheels\n\n\n\nThere are different types of bases that give teams different advantages. Below is a list of different types of bases and their advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe Actual Drives\nTank Drive\n\n  Most common type of drive train in FRC\n  2 parallel sets of wheels on opposite sides\n  Skid steering, each side being independently powered\n  Usually uses around 2-6 motors\n  Either a motor for each wheel, or connecting the directly powered wheel to a dead axle (which is called West Coast Drive)\n  Uses mostly traction wheels\n  Can put omni wheels in the front or back to increase mobility\n\n\nPros:\n\n  Easy to build\n  Easy to drive\n  Simple programming\n  Powerful in direct contact\n  Relatively light, especially with less motors\n\n\nCons:\n\n  Low agility compared to other drives\n  Cannot strafe\n\n\n\n\nA West Coast Drive model made by 1719\n\nMecanum Drive\n\n  Similar layout to tank; uses 2 parallel sets of wheels on opposite sides\n  Skid steering, but each wheel must be independently powered\n  Can also strafe\n  Uses mecanum wheels\n  By using the 45-degree angled rollers, different combinations of wheel rotations allow the robot to move like a tank, but also strafe\n\n\nPros:\n\n  Relatively easy to build\n  Only difference from tank being that orientation of wheels is important\n  Can strafe, so very agile\n\n\nCons:\n\n  More difficult to program (the different combinations of wheel rotations)\n  Terrible pushing power\n  Difficult to drive\n  Set number of motors\n  Expensive wheels\n\n\n\n\nA mecanum drive model made by 1640\n\nSlide Drive/H Drive\n\n  Again, very similar to tank drive\n    \n      However, all wheels must be omni wheels\n      There is a perpendicular wheel in the middle\n    \n  \n  Skid steering\n  Can strafe (using the perpendicular wheel)\n\n\nPros:\n\n  Relatively easy to build\n  Good agility\n  Easy to drive\n  Relatively easy to program\n\n\nCons:\n\n  Low pushing power\n  Must have perpendicular wheel in the center of gravity\n  Difficult to design weight distribution for the wheel\n\n\n\n\nA slide drive with two perpendicular wheels made by 4557\n\nCritter Drives (Butterfly and Grasshopper)\n\n  Again, parallel sets of wheels on opposite sides\n  Uses pneumatics to switch from omni wheels to traction wheels\n    \n      Butterfly has this for all four wheels while grasshopper only has it for the back two\n    \n  \n  Extra Note: There are several other types of drive designs that stem from the butterfly drive, such as Octocanum (replacing omni wheels with mechanum) and Butterslide (mixing butterfly with slide)\n\n\nPros:\n\n  Amazing versatility (omni and traction)\n  Powerful\n  Relatively simple to program\n\n\nCons:\n\n  Still not as agile as other drives (for the same reason as tank)\n  Somewhat difficult to design\n\n\n\n\nA butterfly drive model made by 4183\n\nHolonomic: X - Drive/Kiwi Drive\n\n  Puts wheels at angles\n    \n      X: 4 wheels at 45-degree angles\n      Kiwi: 3 wheels at 120-degree angles\n    \n  \n  A motor for each wheel, meaning each wheel drives independently\n  Technically no “front”\n  Can strafe in any direction\n\n\nPros:\n\n  Simple build\n  Amazing agility\n  Only 3 or 4 motors\n  Light\n\n\nCons:\n\n  Difficult programming\n  Terrible pushing power\n  Difficult to get used to driving\n\n\n\n\nExample of a holonomic X - drive made by 3397\n\nSwerve Drive\n\n  Arguably the best drive\n  Wheels rotate on vertical axis to change direction\n  Usually uses traction wheels\n    \n      With on wheel in each corner\n    \n  \n  Requires sensors to know orientation of wheels\n\n\nPros:\n\n  Amazing agility\n  Very powerful\n  Can move in all directions without turning\n\n\nCons:\n\n  Most difficult drive to program\n  Difficult to build/design (though many teams buy them)\n  8 motors (2 per wheel, one for driving, one for steering)\n  Heavy\n  Difficult to get used to driving\n\n\n\n\nA stripped-down model of a swerve module made by 346. There would be one of these modules in each corner of the robot.\n\nND Subison Robotics\n\nTeam 4904 example\n\n",

          "content": "FRC Indexers and Storages\n\nWhat’s the difference?\n\nThe storage is the secondary holding place after the robot has gained control of the game object whereas the indexer is the funneling system from the storage to the shooter. Essentially the pathways goes from:\n\n\n\nAn easy way to remember this is; the storage is the structure and the indexer is the final moving stage or used as a sorting function. In games where multiple game objects can be held, the storage will be used to hold those other objects not being shot as to avoid jamming. In a game with only one object available to be possessed at a time, the indexer can be used as a sort of funnel for an expedited transition between the two systems. For these reasons, storages and indexers aren’t always necessary to be used together.\n\nCommon Types:\nWhile the structure of the storage is bound to change depending on the size requirements, necessity, and function of the system, there are common mechanisms for the indexer that have been used to move the game objects within the bot.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Type\n      What is it\n      Pros\n      Cons\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Belts\n      Think conveyor belt for the game object that constrains it on the top and the bottom. In the 2020 game, “Infinite Recharge,” the team used polyurethane belts to transition the “power cells” from the intake to the shooter.\n      This will allow for complete control of the game object and an efficient transition between intake and shooter.\n      However, belts can be wrecked easily during a high contact match and they are heavy. They also have the potential to take up a lot of space within the robot.\n    \n    \n      Rollers\n      Similar to how a belt would function, rollers would constrain the game object from the top and bottom.\n      Rollers are lighter than belts and stronger in a higher impact match.\n      There is less control than a belt would have and they can take up a lot of space. Depending on the game object, the rollers can compress the game object in the wrong direction.\n    \n    \n      Polycord\n      Previously this was used on our 2022 bot for the game, “Rapid React.” It was 4 polycord bands that brought the balls up from the intake to a flywheel.\n      This was able to save space within the interior of the bot.\n      It was weak control of the game object and the balls would end up slipping a lot.\n    \n    \n      Flex Wheels\n      For the 2024 game, “Crescendo,” flex wheels were used to pass the note from the intake up into the flywheel.\n      Flex wheels were the easiest to use in the minimal space that was provided and best compressed the note to transition it the best to the flywheel.\n      They can be heavy and figuring out the spacing between the flex wheels could be a specific measurement requiring some extra work.\n    \n  \n\n\n‎\n\nExamples:\nThere isn’t a guide or a specific way that indexers can be designed, but some types work better for different game objects. In years previous there have been:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Game Pieces\n      Game\n      Link\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Small/Medium Balls\n      Basketballs in the 2012 FRC game ‘Rebound Rumble’ \\ Fuel in the 2017 game ‘Steamworks’ \\ Power Cells in the 2020 and 2021 game ‘Infinite Recharge’.\n      Indexer: Small and Medium Balls - YouTube\n    \n    \n      Large Balls\n      254’s robot for the 2014 FRC game ‘Aerial Assist’\n      Indexer: Large Balls - Youtube\n    \n    \n      Cubes\n      Some teams have designed mechanisms with a hand off from the intake to the scoring mechanism. 2017-18 FTC game ‘Relic Recovery’\n      Indexer: Cubes - Youtube\n    \n    \n      Frisbees/Rings\n      FRC 2013 game ‘Ultimate Ascent’ \\ 2020-21 FTC game ‘Ultimate Goal’\n      Indexer: Frisbees/Rings - Youtube\n    \n    \n      Totes and Cans\n      2015 FRC game ‘Recycle Rush’\n      Indexer: Totes and Cans - Youtube\n    \n  \n\n\n",

          "content": "Launchers:\n\nFlywheel\n\n  To increase the inertia of the system( the force acted upon and item) -&gt;need to increase the speed and/or mass of the wheel.\n  When a flywheel shoots -&gt; it slows down -&gt; it does not behave the same way as you may have intended or inaccurate\n    \n      Can be solved by adding inertia to the system or pick the right motor () for the job.\n      However by adding speed it may not make the shooter perform in the intended way and weight is not always the best to add with the 120 weight limit -&gt; could add another wheel that is much faster to increase inertia and keep performance\n    \n  \n  Mass at the edge of a wheel gives more inertia than towards the axis of rotation\n  Hex bearings: have a tendency to not be as sturdy for fast speed forces or else use https://www.mcmaster.com/6138K15/\n  Thunderhex or round bearings: have better stabillity 6\n    \n      \n        For more information on thunderhex see the following\nChief Delphi,\nVex Robotics,\n1712 Example:\n\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nContacts item -&gt; needs some time to catch up to speed -&gt; add more wheels so it has contact for longer -&gt; Flywheel shoots -&gt; some energy goes to the object shot -&gt; To stop, increase the motor power or the momentum (mass) (not always needed though, especially for small distances)\n\nCompression: is the amount something is “squished” -&gt; try designing for adistablility since it will require lots of testing. Must find the sweet spot. \nIncreasing the amount of squish increases the acceleration that an object has from the flywheel.\n\nTo change accuracy:\n\n  Add backspin by adding another roller or get rid of it all together \nLook into when it lands how does it bounce.\n\n\nSingle Flywheel Shooter:\n\n  Shooter and shooter hood(to compress it)\n  Usually the most compact and easiest to make into a turret\n\n\nDual flywheel shooter:\n\n  2 wheels that can be at different speeds and angles depending on the task(for example they could be at different angles to put some spin on a football)\n  Is best to link the two wheels with belts, chain, or gears\n\n\nNow based off of the type of game objects\n\n\n  \n    \n      Type\n      Description\n      Examples\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Small Balls\n      Typically lighter and more of them to score -&gt; they can shoot faster -&gt; need faster flywheel. However with it being faster itis hard to make sure it is always accurate and the speed draws lots of power from the rest of the robot.\n      Some examples of how people have used this:  Ex1, Ex2,  Ex3,  These are good example of an accurate catapults.\n    \n    \n      Medium Balls\n      Slower fire rates than small balls. Design will also depend on possession limits.\n      Ex1: This is a good example of an accurate catapult as well. Ex2: This takes a flywheel approach for the same game.\n    \n    \n      Large Balls\n      Requires mechanisms much larger. Can integrate a flywheel or catapult into it but it depends on where it needs to go and the size requirements.\n      Ex1, Ex2: This one has slightly smaller balls and they were able to go directly through the robot.\n    \n    \n      Cubes\n      Most commonly picked and placed by robots, sometimes have been shot.\n      Ex1, Ex2, Ex3\n    \n    \n      Frisbes/ Rings\n      Depending on the game sometimes they need some spin or they just need vertical compression.\n      Ex1, Ex2 This one is from the 2024 game where the game pieces were manipulated much more.\n    \n  \n\n\nCatapult\nGood for objects that do not rely on accuracy or compression, and are irregular shaped objects that are not possible with flywheel.\n\nPneumatics\nLaunches things using pneumatic cylinders\nCan be aided with springs or elastics to increase the force of the launch.\nPressure changes = accuracy changes\n\nSlip Gear Catapults:\nGear missing teeth meshes with a gear with all the teeth and an arm attached \nIt keeps going and springs when it hits that open gear part.\nHowever it could damage the gear depending on the load.\n\nDrop Cam Catapult\nhttps://www.technologystudent.com/cams/cam10.htm \nA mechanism with that launches when a certain point is reached on the cam.\nThis is not very popular but this system my be useful to incorporate into a design.\nLook into math and how to calculate a cam (robert)\n\nChoo-choo catapult\nRetracts using some sort of elastic and a spinning thing doing a choo choo movement.\n\nLinear punchers (can only go in one direction)\nSpring Loaded Linear Puncher\nUsing a pull back mechanism to compress some spring or form of energy to release a mechanism\nThere are a variety of pull back mechanisms such as\nBall Screw pulling back shooter plate to launch \nChain pulling back shooter plate to the desired position\nPneumatic Linear Punch\nPneumatic actuators push something out of the robot.

Commonly mounted to shooters or an arm/elevator. Makes the robot very complex, especially if there is a large load at the top. They are not always necessary in order to play competitively but can give a design advantage. They take a lot of time and prototyping in order to build along with fab and programming resources and will make you sacrifice a motor slot in order to pull them.\n\nTurret bearing types\n\n\n  \n    \n      Bearing type\n      Pros/Cons\n      Image\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Lazy Susan\n      Simple and cheap. One large COTS bearing. Usually can support the weight but impacts can cause it to break and separate. Can struggle to support the loading from other mechanisms on the robot.\n      \n    \n    \n      Shoulder Bolts with Bearings\n      Most common. Stacks of bearings of different sizes that are  perpendicular to the metal and the top and bottom are the same size bearing while the middle is slightly smaller. Works well for shooter turrets. Higher part count than lazy susan but offers more flexibility.\n      Look at hightide cads or things on chief delphi\n    \n    \n      3D Blocks with bearings riding on all surfaces\n      Similar to the shoulder bolts with bearing but basically has a custom block with bearings on 3 sides of the turret ring(two vertically on top and one horizontally to the side). The blocks are very complex and would have to be CNC. Is better because all bearings are receiving a part of the load.\n      \n    \n    \n      Singular X-bearing\n      It is a bearing that is created with archways that allows for moment and axial loads to be accepted. It is best for mechanisms with large moment loads. Used most commonly for swerve modules. Can be expensive.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n‎\n\nTurret drive types\n\n\n  \n    \n      Name Lightest/weakest -&gt; Strongest/heaviest\n      Description/Pros/Cons\n      Images\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Belt Driven\n      Very dependent on the space you have for it and the friction that is on it. Design must consider all of it together and the other systems. Simple if you want it to turn less than 360 -&gt; Can attach to the drive plate with bolts or rivets. Though it will not be able to pass any of the bolts on the belt. If needed to turn more than 360 deg then might have to 3d print a large pulley teeth or find another alternative. Could possibly wear out the belt/pulley\n      \n    \n    \n      Chain Driven\n      Very large Turret Sprocket would be used along with a smaller sprocket attached to a motor.

Though there are many different types of screws, most teams only use a select few for simplicity and more storage space.\n  For American screws, you will see their dimensions written out as: # number – number\n    \n      The first number represents the diameter while the second represents the threading\n      For example, #4-40 means that the screw has a diameter of 0.112 inches and there are 40 threads per inch\n      In some cases, mostly for larger screws, the first number is replaced with the nearest fraction of the diameter of the screw\n      This page lists which numbers mean what size\n        \n          https://monsterbolts.com/pages/us-screw-sizes\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  For Metric screws, you will see their dimensions written out as: M number x number x number\n    \n      The first number represents the diameter, the second represents the pitch, and the third represents the length\n      For example, M12 x 1.75 x 85 means that the screw has a diameter of 12 millimeters, has a pitch of 1.75, and is 85 millimeters long\n    \n  \n  For our team, we, of course, use mostly American screws. The most common we use are #6-32, #8-32, #10-32, and ¼-20\n  Below is a table that shows and explains the different types of bolts and gives links to order them (this was taken directly from the NASA\nRobotics Alliance Project Robotics Design Guide)\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Screw Type\n      Description\n      Photo\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Socket/Cap Head Bolt\n      Standard go-to bolt, the strongest of all of the socket head, the hex is the hardest socket head to strip out.\n      \n    \n    \n      Flat Head/Countersunk Bolt\n      Is meant to be flush with the material, requires you to countersink the hole. Most standard bolts use an 82° countersink. Most metric bolts use a 90° countersink.\n      \n    \n    \n      Button Head Bolt\n      A bolt with a rounded head for areas where a cap head bolt is too large or you don’t want the bolt head to catch on anything.\n      \n    \n    \n      Low Profile Bolt\n      A bolt with a head that isn’t as tall for use in areas where a cap head bolt is too large.\n      \n    \n    \n      Shoulder Bolt\n      Bolt with a precision smooth section meant to fit into a bearing or bushing and act as a shaft.\n      \n    \n    \n      Set Screw/Grub Screw\n      Screw used to keep something positioned on a shaft or to transmit torque. It is best to avoid these. If they are used, they should only be used to hold axial position on a shaft, not to transmit torque.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n‎\n\nNuts are just as important as fasteners, because without them, these bolts would be virtually useless. \nNuts only work with screws with the same threading. So, when using a #8-32 screw, you must use a #8-32 nut.\nBelow is a table that shows and explains the different types of nuts and gives links to order them (this was taken directly from the NASA Robotics Alliance Project Robotics Design Guide)\n\nNuts are just as important as fasteners, because without them, these bolts would be virtually useless. \nNuts only work with screws with the same threading.

Has a nylon insert that prevents the bolt from loosening.\n      \n    \n    \n      Thin Lock Nut\n      Used when a standard lock nut is too large.\n      \n    \n    \n      Regular Nut\n      A normal nut, typically only used when creating a “jam nut” where two nuts are tightened against each other on a threaded rod.\n      \n    \n    \n      Tee Nut\n      A type of nut pressed into wood. Sometimes used in bumpers.\n      \n    \n    \n      Wing Nut\n      A type of nut meant to be tightened by hand. Convenient for removing without the use of tools. Can be useful for attaching bumpers.\n      \n    \n    \n      Pem Nut\n      A nut that is pressed into a part, usually in a part that is too thin to tap well. It’s important to check McMaster for what size the holes the part needs to be for the desired pem nut.\n      \n    \n    \n      Flush Pem Nut\n      A pem nut that is used in sheet metal and mounts flush with the material.\n      \n    \n    \n      Heat Set Inserts\n      Used in 3D-printed or other plastic parts. A hole is designed for a specific size listed on McMaster, and then the threaded brass insert is pressed in using a soldering iron.\n      \n    \n    \n      Rivnuts\n      Similar to a pem nut, except it is installed with a specialty tool, similar to a rivet gun. Can be used as an alternative to tapping a hole. Rivnuts are useful for hard-to-reach locations (i.e. box tubing or thin sheet). Rivnuts can be used to provide a semi-permanent nut in a location.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n‎\n\n\n  There are many methods to retain nuts and make sure they do not come off the screw. Next are a few ways to do this.\n    \n      Loctite:\n        \n          Loctite is one of the most common ways to retain nuts. It is a liquid that solidifies on threads and prevents bolts from coming lose from vibrations, which is the most common way bolts come lose on FRC robots. Blue 242 Loctite is used for #8 screws and smaller while Red 262 Loctite is used for #10 screws and larger. For stronger Loctite, the best way to remove the bolt is to heat it up. It is also important to note that Loctite can ruin certain materials, most notably polycarbonate, it touches. Loctite also ruins the nylon on nyloc nuts, so do not use them together.\n          As you can see, Loctite is applied to the area that the nut will be\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Nylon Lock Nuts (Nyloc Nuts):\n    \n      Nylon lock nuts are lock nuts with a nylon selection the bolt threads into. This makes it tighter and prevents the nuts from becoming loose from vibrations. It is generally agreed that these can be reused. Just remember, do not use them with Loctite.\n        \n          The white nylon in the lock nut creates a tighter fit\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Lock Heli-Coils (Screw Thread Inserts):\n    \n      Locking Heli-coils are inserted into threaded holes and retain bolts and repair broken threading. The hole is tapped with a specific Heli-coil tap, and with a Heli-coil Insert Tool, the insert is threaded into the hole.\n      The coil goes around the screw to either tighten it or fix a broken thread\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  It is also important to note that fasteners require specific hex key drive sizes and nuts require specific wrench sizes. This page displays the correct tools for different sizes:\n    \n      https://monsterbolts.com/pages/us-socket-screw-drive-sizes\n    \n  \n\n\nTaps and Dies\n\n\n  Similarly to nuts and bolts, you can also use taps and dies to create threading\n  Taps allow you to put threading into a part, so you do not need a nut with the screw. To do this, put a hole in the part that is smaller than the tap (there are specific sizes you should use for different taps). Then, with some sort of lubricant, you screw the tap into the hole. Below is a picture from Custom Part Net that shows this process:\n\n\n\n\n\n  It is best not to tap a part less than 1/16” thick. If you 1/16” thick part needs to carry a heavy load, you should just use a screw and nut.\nIt is also best to get at least 4 threads into the material, meaning that the depth of your hole varies based on your thread size.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Dies are the opposite of taps. They create threading on the outside of a part, which basically creates your own screw. To do this, you rotate the die around your part. Dies are not used very often in FRC, though. Below is a picture from Threading Tools Guide that shows this process:\n  \n  \n    Also notable, for threaded holes in 3D printed parts, it is best to use heat set inserts. These are brass threaded inserts that are pressed into plastic parts with a soldering iron. There are also inserts that do not need soldering.\n  \n\n\nRivets\n\n\n  Rivets are another type of fastener to connect parts. Rivets are usually used with thinner metal sheets. You can also add rivets to an already connected assembly to strengthen attachments. Blind rivets are a one-time use fastener that only require access to one side of your assembly.\n  There are two main parts of a rivet, as seen in the picture below\n\n\n\n\n\n  How the blind rivet works: The head of the mandrel goes first when you put the rivet into the hole. You use a rivet gun to pull the mandrel. As it is pulled, the shank is deformed and creates a sort of head that prevents the rivet from coming out. As you can see, there is also a pre-made tear in the mandrel. This eventually breaks, which allows the rivet to take little room.\n  You should not use rivets in places that you are expecting to take apart often. This is because to take out rivets, you must drill them out. Not only can this take longer than a simple nut and bolt, but constant drilling can eventually make the hole too big to use a rivet. However, this can be solved by drilling the holes for the next largest rivet (but you can only do this so many times).\n  It is important to use the correct length rivet. If the rivet is too short, the deformation might not be very strong, and if it is too long, then it might not deform enough to hold the parts together.\n  Below is a table with rivets sizes and when drill bit to use for them:\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Rivet Size\n      Drill Bit to Use\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1/8”\n      30\n    \n    \n      5/32”\n      20\n    \n    \n      3/16”\n      11\n    \n  \n\n\n‎\n\nWelding\n\n\n  Welding is a light, strong, and permanent way of connected pieces, which is why it is usually only used for drivetrains and superstructure. When designing welding parts, it is best to also design some sort of way to hold the parts while they are welded.\n  Welding is a big investment for most teams. Along with the cost, welding is highly skill-dependent, and the skill of the welder influences the outcome more than the quality of the materials being used. For this reason, teams often pay sponsors or have experienced mentors to do the welding for them.\n  Welding has many things to keep in mind:\n    \n      Welded assemblies almost always have some sort of warping, so it is best to design with some tolerance in mind for this.\n      When welding enclosed materials like tubing, it is best to include small holes near welds because if not, gasses may get trapped in there.\n      Welds can, obviously, break, so you should probably have fail-safe kits with “scab plates” that you can use to reconnect these broken assemblies.\n      Welding parts together creates a bump of metal between the pieces. These can be grinded down, but this makes the weld much weaker. It is best to simply keep in mind these bumps when designing.\nBelow is a picture of a corner that was welded for strength done by 95:\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nBox Tubing\n\n\n  Box tubing is probably the most used structure in FRC robots. It is a hollow tube with a square or rectangular shape.\n  Tubes can be connected with welding, gussets, or connecting blocks.\n  3D Printed Connecting blocks:\n    \n      3D blocks are used to connect tubing. It is especially useful for strengthening a connection between parts that are already welded or have gussets.\n      To use them, you make two that connect to each other. You screw the first block into one of the box tubes. This screw also connects the two 3D printed blocks together. Then, you can attach the second block to the other tube.\n      This picture of 118’s 2017 robot displays a use of 3D printed connecting blocks in a chassis:\n  \n    \n  \n  Gussets:\n    \n      Gussets are simple, extremely common, and extremely important. The purpose of gussets is to connect two pieces without directly bolting them to each other. This creates clean assemblies and makes it much easier to work with your assemblies.\n        \n          For example, if you wanted to have two box tubes perpendicular to each other, you could attach them to each other directly like this:\n  \n          This, however, can be improved with a gusset (represented by the yellow piece):\n  \n          This makes the assembly look cleaner, but more importantly, it is easier to work with. Designing on a flat and even surface is easier than one that is crowded with bumps. Of course, there will be some cases where you are looking for the structure you see in the first picture. But in many cases, gussets help.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Also know that 3D printing blocks and gussets are not ONLY used for box tubing. They are just a common tool for working with box tubing but can be used whenever you find them useful. Do not limit yourself in that way.\n\n\nRound Tubing\n\n\n  Round tubing is not as common as box tubing. Again, it is hollow tubing, only this one in a circular shape.\n  Compared to box tubing, round tubing is typically around 20% lighter and can be molded into shapes that can prove to be very strong and useful. It also has stronger torsion.\n  The downside of round tubing is that it is much harder to machine and design with. The lack of a flat surface makes it difficult to secure anything on it, which can make it a pain to use. For this reason, round tubing is not very common in FRC robots.\n  Sometimes, though, this may not be an issue. For example, 118’s 2014 robot use round tubing as a simple way to hold a giant ball:\n\n  Listed below are many effective ways to use/work with round tubing:\n  Clamping:\n    \n      This attachment method squeezes the tube between two parts to keep it in place.\n      A great example is, again, from 118’s 2014 robot:\n\n    \n  \n  Welding:\n    \n      Again, as previously mentioned, round tubing can be difficult to work with. When welding, thin walls require skillful precision and are easy to mess up.\n    \n  \n  Tube Inserts:\n    \n      Similarly to clamps, tube inserts give a place to stick a round tube into. This method is normally used when the tube will not be experiencing high loads or strong impacts.\n    \n  \n  \n    A great example is from 118’s 2017 robot, where the inserts were put in the corners for the tubes, which made up the frame of the robot:\n\n  \n  Rod Ends:\n    \n      Rod ends give tubes a practical place to attach to. It also allows to get very specific angles, which makes rod ends perfect for triangle bracing.\n    \n  \n  Below is a picture of a rod end:\n\n\n\nPlate and Standoff Structures\n\n\n  Standoffs are threaded spacers. When you want to elevate a plate from a certain surface, using standoffs is usually a good option. Doing this creates another plane to build on while also having room under it to add other things. This extra space makes this structure very popular for gearboxes, where the plate can hold the other end of the shaft.\n  It is best to use COTs standoffs, as this will take away unnecessary machining time.\n  Below is a picture of WCP’s DS gearbox, which uses this plate and standoff method to fit the shafts and gears:\n\n\n\nBent Sheet Metal\n\n\n  By bending sheets, you can give multiple functions to a single part, which creates simplicity and lightweight.\n  The bend radius is the inside radius of a bend. This page shows a table by the Aluminum Association which tells you the best bend radii to use with certain thicknesses: Chart.\n  Flange: The flange is the section of a part that you are bending. It is usually the part you put inside a brake to bend it. The length of your flanges should be at least 4 times the part’s thickness, or else the bend will turn out bad.\n  Holes should not go close to bends. If you do need a hole near a bend, it is best to have the hole at least 2 times the part thickness away from the bend.\n  Bends stretch the outside of the part and shrink the inside of the part. Between these is a line of metal that is not affected. This is called the neutral axis.\n  The K-factor is the ratio of the location of the neutral axis (t) to the material’s thickness (T). With this information, you can determine how much the neutral axis has moved from the center, and therefore, how much longer the sheet metal becomes.\n\n\n\nSlots and Tabs\n\n\n  Slots and tabs are a useful way to attach perpendicular parts in an easy and sturdy way. One part has an extrusion while the other part has a slot that fits that extrusion.\n  \n    Also, the part with the extrusion has a screw hole while the part with the slot has a place to hold a nut. This prevents any tapping. Below is an example of this:\n  \n  The hole for the screw is a simple clearance hole. The hole for the nut should have a little clearance to make sure it fits\n\n\n\nLightening Patterns\n\n\n  As previously mentioned, to save weight, teams will sometimes need to add pockets to their parts to make them lighter. These pockets are called lightening holes, and listed next are the different types of lightening patterns:\n    \n      Isogrid:\n        \n          Isogrid uses 6 equilateral triangles surrounding a circle in the middle. It usually takes longer to machine because of the many pockets. It is important to remember, though, that triangles are the strongest shape. And strength is important especially for lightening holes because pocketing takes away the strength of the part.\n        \n      \n      \n        Below is an example of an isogrid on 118’s 2017 robot:\n  \n      \n      Triangles:\n        \n          Again, triangles are the strongest shape. It is also easy to fit them together neatly in patterns, which takes away a lot of weight.\n        \n      \n      \n        Below is an example of triangle pockets on 3476’s robot:\n  \n      \n      Circles:\n        \n          Circles are the easiest lightening holes to make, as you can make them with a drill press if you need. Some teams end up drilling holes into their robot when they realize that their finished robot is too heavy.\n        \n      \n      Below is an example of circle pockets on 118’s 2013 robot:\n  \n    \n  \n  Non-Standard and Gearboxes:\n    \n      In many cases, mostly for plates, you will need to make abstract lightening holes. To do this, you take away as much material as possible, but leave struts that connect the bolts, bearings, and other holes on the plate. You must also leave a good amount of material around these holes so that they can handle their load.\n      When making the plate, try to put the holes in ways that will form triangles. And when you have a rectangular area that needs pocketing, you can split that into two triangles.\n    \n  \n  \n    Below is an example of this type of pocketing on a gearbox made by 3008:\n\n  \n  Half-Depth Pocketing:\n    \n      You can also create pockets that do not go all the way through the wall of the part. This leaves behind a shell that is around half the weight of what it previously was. You must use caution, though, because it is easy to make this shell too thin and take away all the strength of the part.\n    \n  \n  Below is an example of half-depth pocketing from GM0:\n\n\n\nSuperstructure\n\n  Simply put, superstructure is another above your drive base. It is usually referred to as the structure that you are connecting all your systems to. Superstructures need to be as minimal as possible while still giving good support for everything on the robot.\n  Most teams have several people working on the robot’s systems, respectively. This makes communication imperative. Each system needs superstructure to attach to the robot, so there cannot be any clashes between systems looking for structure in the same area. And in a similar way, it is important to make sure that there is no redundancy and to see if certain structures can be used for multiple systems.\n  In the picture below, you can see a robot by 254. The grey metal can be considered part of the superstructure:\n\n\n\n\n",

          "content": "How to write an article\n\nWriting an article is fairly straightforward, but there are a couple things that you need to know:\n\nAll articles must start with something called front matter, which describes to our site how the page should be categorized. For our site, it should look something like this:\n    ---\n    layout: default\n    title:  Bluetooth\n    author: Joshua Duross\n    permalink: /programming/bluetooth.html\n    nav_order: 2\n    ---\n\nIt’s fairly straightforward, and most of it is really just copy and paste. It starts and ends with \n\n3 hyphens “---” and has some tags describing the site and how it should look.\n\nHere’s a description of those tags:\n\n  layout: tells the site which layout to use. As of now, there is only default, but more may be added in the future.\n  title: The short-version title of your Documentation Page. This is only shown to the user at the top “breadcrumb” bar, but most importantly used in the search functionality (So keep it short and sweet!)\n  author: The First and Last name of the author(s) of the page. Currently it is only used in the search functionality, but may be used for other purposes later. If there are multiple authors, separate the names with commas.\n  permalink: The link (at the top of the site) at which this file is displayed. This one is a bit more complicated, but shouldn’t be too bad. It is important to note:\n    \n      This is the only NECESSARY tag, as without it the site will not recognize your page.\n      This should probably be very similar to something like in the example, ex: /[subsystem-name]/[article-name].html.\n      If you need any help, ask one of us programmers, we should be able to help!\n    \n  \n  nav_order: The last one that most people will need to use, tells the site which order to put the articles in. For example: For this example article, it would be the second article shown under the Programming tab.\n\n\nSee this link for all other possible tags\n\nThe rest of the page after the front matter is written in markdown, which is a text format that allows for some ways to spice up your text. (Fun fact: If you’ve bolded or used italics in Discord or Ryver, you were using markdown syntax!). You can also add bullets points with hyphens - and numbered lists with numbers followed by periods 1. 2. ect.\n \n\nYou can create headings with the pound sign# followed by a space. It is recommended to add blank lines before and after. Using more pound signs will decrease the size of the headings to a max of six. You should add a heading at the beginning of your article.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\n# big heading\n\n\n Big Heading \n\n\n# Smaller heading\n\n\n Smaller Heading \n\n\n\nA new -IN TESTING- feature added recently is notes, which can be used by adding a !!  at the beginning of the line. This syntax is subject to change, but currently you have to make sure you add a space after the exclamation points, as it will not work otherwise. A note looks like this:\n\n!! This is a note!It also still supports links and formatting!\n\n!!i You can also append the letters w or i right after the exclamation marks to get different types of notes, like this.\n\nTo create separate lines with notes, you must use the HTML &lt;br&gt;, tag, otherwise it will not work.\n\nAnyway, it’s not difficult, and you can check out The Basic Markdown Syntax Guide for help with the basic syntax, or AdvancedHowTo if you think you’re ready for something more advanced.\n\n Good luck! \n",

          "title": "Bluetooth",
          "author": "Joshua Duross",
          "content": "Bluetooth\n\nPrologue\n\nBluetooth is a complicated piece of technology, and even with me working with it quite a bit throughout the course of the last year, I feel that I’ve still barely even cracked the surface with how much there is to know about it. Throughout this article, I will provide mainly just the basics for what you may need when using in the context of the scouting app, but will try my best to provide links to things for further learning. Note that these are not manditory to read, but optional, for if you may need to edit the underlying code or just want to learn more.\n\nOur API\n\nBackground Info\n\nTo simplify the process of dealing with Bluetooth for our scouting purposes, we have created a simple wrapper on top of the Windows Bluetooth API. The main file, at least on the main computer, is bluetooth.hpp. This file handles many things such as initializing and connecting sockets, and may get condensed in the future. For now, though, the main function you will have to worry about is handleReadyConnections(), and even more specifically, the part that says // ___ read from all sockets connected ___\n\n(If you would like to go more in depth, you can continue on to the\n Windows API \n section)\n\n. In this section, we create a bthSocketHandler object, which is what we should be working with in order to get data from the tablets. There are a couple things to note about this object:\n\n  The constructor requires a bt::SOCKET struct (a struct is very similar to an object, at least in C++). This is supplied by functions in the bluetooth.hpp class.\n  there are also a couple options that can be set to your preference:\n    \n      the setLaunchPolicy() function takes a bt::SOCKETCALLTYPE enum, the options being bt::CALLTYPE_ASYNCHRONOUS, bt::CALLTYPE_DEFERRED, and bt::CALLTYPE_DEFAULT. As Bluetooth is a relatively expensive operation, this class allows bluetooth to be called in two different states: async and deferred. when this option is set to bt::CALLTYPE_ASYNCHRONOUS, code will be run immediately as it is called- on a different thread, while bt::CALLTYPE_DEFERRED will defer the call until .get() is called (which will be explained further later). bt::CALLTYPE_DEFAULT lets the OS choose whichever it prefers in the current moment.\n    \n  \n\n\nUsing the Object\n\nData is obtained from the socket using the readTabletData() function in the bthSocketHandler class, which, instead of just returning the data, returns a pointer to a bt::READRES struct. This struct contains a couple things:\n\n  A bt::TRANSACTIONTYPE called transactionType, which is an enum describing what type of data is being sent from the tablet.\n  An std::future&lt;std::vector&lt;char&gt;&gt; called data, which is where the data is stored.\n  A bool, reportedSuccess, which is true (or false) based on whether getting the data succeded. Note that calling this before calling .get() WILL cause undefined behaviour.\n  a function, isReady(), which, when in async mode, tells you if the funcion has finished. If the function was called using the deferred option, this will always return true.\n\n\nSo, what is this std::future thing, and why do I keep taling about the .get() function? Well, std::future is a class that allows you to call a function, and possibly have it run in the background\n(if you use the async calltype)\n, where you can then use the .get() function to actually get the result later. So in our bluetooth code, the .get() function on data would return an std::vector&lt;char&gt;. The benefit of this is that we can have the option to have the bluetooth code run in the background (communicating to possibly multiple tablets at a time), while the frontend can continue working in the same way as it normally does, without it freezing up. We can also handle the data when it is convenient to us, rather than immediately.\n\nWindows API\nThough it has been the goal to keep things fairly surface-level to use, there are probably going to be things that you will need the Windows Winsock API for, especially if you need to edit anything about these two classes. When working with Winsock, the documentation link (check the search bar on the left), and especially the winsock error codes page will be your friends.\n\nOur code is also fairly well commented, so you can try reading the comments on our code if you get stuck.\n\n!! We put all of the Winsock bluetooth functions in the bt namespace, so make sure to prepend all functions with bt::.\n\nGL!\n",

          "title": "Swerve",
          "author": "Will Seguin",
          "content": "Swerve\n\nIn this guide, we will walk through the first steps for creating a usable swerve drive. The first of these steps is to create a subsystem to store swerve modules. \n\nCreating the Objects\n\nThe first step in making the Swerve module class is to create all of the objects that you will need:\n\nprivate CANSparkMax angleMotor;\nprivate CANSparkFlex driveMotor;\n\nprivate CANcoder canCoder;\nprivate RelativeEncoder driveEncoder;\n\nprivate PIDController angleController;\nprivate SparkPIDController drivingPidController;\n\nprivate SwerveModulePosition prevPosition;\n\nprivate double offset;\n\n\nThe first two objects are the Drive motors. The type of motor object that we use will depend on the type of motor mounted on the robot. For any further info consult Motor Controllers.\n\nprivate CANSparkMax angleMotor;\nprivate CANSparkFlex driveMotor;\n\n\nThe second two objects are the encoders that we use for controlling the motors. The first is the rotation CanCoder mounted on the top of the module and gives us data on the the rotation of the wheel. The second is the drive motor encoder which tells us the relative speed of the drive motor. For any more questions consult Encoders. \n\nprivate CANcoder canCoder;\nprivate RelativeEncoder driveEncoder;\n\n\nThe third two objects are the PID controllers. These are used to more accurately control the rotation and drive functions of the module. For any questions consult How to PID.\n\nprivate PIDController angleController;\nprivate SparkPIDController drivingPidController;\n\n\n Fourth, we use a object called a Swerve module position. This records the angle and relative speed of the module as a module state. \n\nprivate SwerveModulePosition prevPosition;\n\n\nFinally, we set an offset on the rotation motor to make sure it points forward. \n\nprivate double offset;\n\n\nWriting the main class\n\nThis second step is to write the actual class for the swerve module. \n\npublic SwerveModule(int angleMotorID, int driveMotorID, int encoderPort, double offset, \n                      boolean driveMotorReversed, boolean angleMotorReversed) {\n    angleMotor = new CANSparkMax(angleMotorID, MotorType.kBrushless);\n    driveMotor = new CANSparkFlex(driveMotorID, MotorType.kBrushless);\n    \n    angleMotor.setIdleMode(IdleMode.kBrake);\n    driveMotor.setIdleMode(IdleMode.kBrake);\n    \n    this.angleMotor.setInverted(angleMotorReversed);\n    this.driveMotor.setInverted(driveMotorReversed);\n    \n    this.driveMotor.setSmartCurrentLimit(KDriveMotorCurrentLimit); // CURRENTLY 85! NEEDS TESTING\n    this.angleMotor.setSmartCurrentLimit(KAngleMotorCurrentLimit); // 40\n\n    canCoder = new CANcoder(encoderPort);\n\n    MagnetSensorConfigs canCoderConfig = new MagnetSensorConfigs();\n\n    double offsetToRotations = offset/360;\n\n    canCoderConfig.AbsoluteSensorRange = AbsoluteSensorRangeValue.Signed_PlusMinusHalf;\n    canCoderConfig.SensorDirection = SensorDirectionValue.CounterClockwise_Positive;\n    canCoderConfig.MagnetOffset = offsetToRotations;\n    canCoder.getConfigurator().apply(canCoderConfig);\n\n    // driveEncoder = driveMotor.getExternalEncoder(Type.kQuadrature, 1);\n    driveEncoder = driveMotor.getEncoder();\n    \n    driveEncoder.setPositionConversionFactor(KDriveMotorRotToMeter);\n    driveEncoder.setVelocityConversionFactor(KDriveMotorRPMToMetersPerSec);\n\n    \n    angleController = new PIDController(KAngleP, 0, KAngleD);\n    angleController.enableContinuousInput(-180, 180); \n      // Tells PIDController that 180 deg is same in both directions\n\n    drivingPidController = driveMotor.getPIDController();\n    drivingPidController.setP(KDrivingPidP);\n    drivingPidController.setI(KDrivingPidI);\n    drivingPidController.setD(KDrivingPidD);\n    drivingPidController.setFF(1/KNeoVortexMaxRPM);\n    drivingPidController.setOutputRange(-1, 1);\n  }\n\n\nThe first step of this is to set up the motor controllers. This has three steps, setting the motor controller to new motor controller objects, telling the motors whether they should be inverted or not, and finally setting the motors current limit. \n\n    angleMotor = new CANSparkMax(angleMotorID, MotorType.kBrushless);\n    driveMotor = new CANSparkFlex(driveMotorID, MotorType.kBrushless);\n    \n    angleMotor.setIdleMode(IdleMode.kBrake);\n    driveMotor.setIdleMode(IdleMode.kBrake);\n    \n    this.angleMotor.setInverted(angleMotorReversed);\n    this.driveMotor.setInverted(driveMotorReversed);\n    \n    this.driveMotor.setSmartCurrentLimit(KDriveMotorCurrentLimit); \n    this.angleMotor.setSmartCurrentLimit(KAngleMotorCurrentLimit);\n\n\nThe second step is to set up for the CanCoder. The CanCoder is setup by creating a CanCoder Configuration object and applying it to the CanCoder. In order to create a config object, you need to tell the object its sensor range, sensor direction, and offset(in rotations). \n\n    canCoder = new CANcoder(encoderPort);\n\n    MagnetSensorConfigs canCoderConfig = new MagnetSensorConfigs();\n\n    double offsetToRotations = offset/360;\n\n    canCoderConfig.AbsoluteSensorRange = AbsoluteSensorRangeValue.Signed_PlusMinusHalf;\n    canCoderConfig.SensorDirection = SensorDirectionValue.CounterClockwise_Positive;\n    canCoderConfig.MagnetOffset = offsetToRotations;\n    canCoder.getConfigurator().apply(canCoderConfig);\n\n\nThe third step is to set up the internal encoder in the drive motor. We also set the motor so it returns data in meters and meters per second. \n\n    driveEncoder = driveMotor.getEncoder();\n    \n    driveEncoder.setPositionConversionFactor(KDriveMotorRotToMeter);\n    driveEncoder.setVelocityConversionFactor(KDriveMotorRPMToMetersPerSec);\n\n\nFinally we create and set the PID controllers.\n\nangleController = new PIDController(KAngleP, 0, KAngleD);\n    angleController.enableContinuousInput(-180, 180); \n      // Tells PIDController that 180 deg is same in both directions\n\n    drivingPidController = driveMotor.getPIDController();\n    drivingPidController.setP(KDrivingPidP);\n    drivingPidController.setI(KDrivingPidI);\n    drivingPidController.setD(KDrivingPidD);\n    drivingPidController.setFF(1/KNeoVortexMaxRPM);\n    drivingPidController.setOutputRange(-1, 1);\n\n\n\n\nSetting Desired Module States\n\nFinally, we need to actually create a function to set tahe module states. This is done using the following functions. \n\n  public void setDesiredState(SwerveModuleState desiredState) {\n    double angleMotorOutput;\n    double driveMotorOutput;\n    \n    Rotation2d currentAngleR2D = getAngleR2D();\n    desiredState = SwerveModuleState.optimize(desiredState, currentAngleR2D);\n    angleMotorOutput = angleController.calculate(getAngleDeg(), desiredState.angle.getDegrees());\n    \n    driveMotorOutput = desiredState.speedMetersPerSecond / KPhysicalMaxDriveSpeedMPS;\n    // driveMotorOutput = desiredState.speedMetersPerSecond;\n    // driveMotorOutput = driveController.calculate(getDriveEncoderVel(), desiredState.speedMetersPerSecond) / KPhysicalMaxDriveSpeedMPS;\n    \n    angleMotor.set(angleMotorOutput);\n    driveMotor.set(driveMotorOutput); \n  }\n\n\n\n\n",
